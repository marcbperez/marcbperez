### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an engineer with over fifteen years of experience developing, testing, deploying and maintaining software. I have built application systems of all sizes, combining Python, React or React Native, Node.js, Java or C (and more), and configured its infrastructure in bare metal servers, Google Cloud Platform and AWS.

When not working on apps and internet-connected systems, I am trying to build computers from scratch using open-source technologies, like the RISC-V architecture and the Linux operating system.
